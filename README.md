# SAMP Phoenix Roleplay Server Files
 
It's OUT OF DATE. I wont help or fix anything about this mode. I edited this mode 3-4 years ago.

It has bugs and maybe backdoors so DO NOT EVEN TRY USE DIRECTLY! You can clone systems, textdraws, maps etc.

Base files from Horizon Roleplay --> not the original one.

Language --> Turkish but variables are english. It's very old and translated H-RP mode.

Registering Method --> MySQL R6-2

It works with Linux/Windows. I tried before
